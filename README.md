![An image of the Home page](src/pics/home_portfolio.png)


## Project Description
As part of the Creating Graphical User Interfaces course at Tampere University, I developed a personal portfolio website. This project showcases my skills in web development and graphic design, featuring a collection of my work from my previous career as a graphic designer. Note that this portfolio focuses exclusively on graphic design work and does not include any UX/UI projects.

The purpose of the course was to learn how to create graphical user interfaces. This project allowed me to apply the skills learned in the course to develop a portfolio website.

## Further Development
While the portfolio demonstrates my skills, there are areas for improvement:

  - **Accessibility:** Addressing current issues to ensure a more inclusive experience.
  - **Layout and CSS:** Refining the design to be responsive across all screen sizes.

Please note that the content of this portfolio, including text and project descriptions, may not always be fully up-to-date. The portfolio is a dynamic work in progress, with updates made sporadically as my studies and professional experience evolve.
